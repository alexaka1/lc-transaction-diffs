Please create a .net console application that does reconciliation of the two data sources attached to this email (data source not included in the project).

The result should be printed to the console in the following order:

* All the transactions that are in the Transactions-A table but not in the Transactions-B table.
* All the transactions that are in the Transactions-B table but not in the Transactions-A table.
* All the values that are different for the same transaction that exists in both tables.

Thank you
